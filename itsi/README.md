## Summary
The ITSI Content Pack for Linux from Kinney Group is meticulously crafted to monitor and ensure the health and performance of Linux operating systems. It utilizes Splunk ITSI to provide comprehensive insights into various system components such as the kernel, filesystem, network, security, and user activity. This content pack is a vital resource for system administrators and IT professionals aiming to maintain system integrity and optimize performance.

* Holistic System Monitoring: Provides a complete overview of the Linux operating system health, including performance metrics and system integrity.
* Targeted Component Insights: Delivers detailed monitoring of critical Linux components such as the kernel, filesystem, network, and security features.
* Proactive Issue Detection: Enables early detection of potential system issues through continuous monitoring of user activity and process management.

This ITSI Content Pack is open source and available for community collaboration and enhancement on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/kinneygroup).

## Details
The ITSI Content Pack for Linux offers a suite of services and KPIs designed to monitor the health and performance of Linux operating systems. It is structured to provide IT professionals with the tools necessary to diagnose and resolve issues promptly, ensuring system stability and efficiency. The content pack addresses common challenges faced in Linux environments, such as resource allocation, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks.

For installation guidance and best practices, refer to the [Kinney Group documentation for installing Content Packs](https://kinneygroup.com/blog/installing-itsi-content-packs/).

### Services
Each service within the content pack is purpose-built based on its reasoning:

- **Linux Operating System Health**: Acts as the central monitoring entity, aggregating data from all underlying components to provide a comprehensive view of system health.
- **Linux Kernel**: Serves as the heart of the Linux operating system, managing core functions and ensuring efficient process and memory management.
- **Linux Filesystem**: Ensures data storage and retrieval processes are functioning correctly, which is crucial for system operation.
- **Linux Network**: Monitors network performance and connectivity, which is independent but critical for data exchange and external communications.
- **Linux Security**: Provides security monitoring to protect the system from unauthorized access and vulnerabilities.
- **Linux User Activity**: Focuses on monitoring user interactions with the system to detect unauthorized access and resource abuse.
- **Linux Process Management**: Manages and monitors running processes to maintain system performance and stability.
- **Linux Memory Management**: Monitors RAM and swap space usage to prevent memory-related issues that can affect system performance.

### KPIs
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are utilized to measure the effectiveness of each service:

- **Context Switches**: Indicates system efficiency by measuring the rate at which the kernel switches between processes.
- **Interrupts**: Monitors hardware interrupts that can impact system performance.
- **Process Creation Rate**: Tracks the rate of new process creation, affecting system load.
- **Filesystem Usage**: Monitors disk space to prevent exhaustion.
- **Inode Usage**: Ensures the filesystem can create new files by tracking inode usage.
- **Disk I/O**: Measures disk read/write speeds and IOPS for potential bottlenecks.
- **Failed Login Attempts**: Detects potential security breaches by monitoring unsuccessful login attempts.
- **Integrity of System Files**: Checks for unauthorized changes to critical system files.
- **Firewall Status**: Ensures firewalls are active and configured correctly.
- **Active User Sessions**: Tracks active user sessions for unauthorized access.
- **Resource Usage by Users**: Monitors resource consumption to identify potential abuse.
- **Process Count**: Monitors the total number of running processes.
- **CPU Usage by Process**: Measures CPU utilization by individual processes.
- **Memory Usage**: Monitors total, used, and free memory.
- **Swap Usage**: Tracks swap space usage to prevent excessive swapping.

### Relationships
#### Dependencies: 
Services such as the Linux Operating System Health depend on the kernel, filesystem, network, security, and user activity to function correctly.
#### Hierarchical Structure: 
Some services have a hierarchical relationship, for example, Linux Kernel relies on Linux Process Management and Linux Memory Management for efficient resource allocation.
